<p>Port Macquarie, as is generally known,
was one of the first Settlements made in
New South Wales. It is intended herein to
give a full and authentic synopsis of the Life
of the Oldest Living Ex-Convict on the
Hastings River, near Port Macquarie, extending
from the thirties onwards. The
information comes purely from memory,
hence exact dates on which certain events
occurred cannot be given; nevertheless the
greatest care has been taken to give dates as
near as possible.</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I was born at Shoreditch, near London, on
the 28th of May, 1819, and was nearing the
age of sixteen when one day I was accused
of committing a paltry theft. Of this I was
innocent, and naturally denied it, but the
constable who accosted me insisted, no
matter what I said, that I had to go with
him. My feelings were anything but high-flown
as I passed along the street with him&mdash;what
boy's feelings would be?&mdash;on the
other hand they were down almost below
zero. It was no use; I soon realised my
position, it was this:&mdash;If I am found guilty
of this offence&mdash;and I have little hope of
proving my innocence&mdash;Heaven only knows
where I may find myself. My trial came
on before a Bench of Magistrates in Worship
Street, London, on July the 3rd, 1834, and
I was committed to take my trial. When
a man had the bad luck to get committed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
he was sent to Clerkenwell, or to the Old
Bailey, and if he listened to the conversations
of his associates at either of these
places, during intervals that he might be
remanded, it was quite possible that a
previously innocent man would be converted
into an adept at picking pockets and house-screwing.
I was a new-chum in places of
this kind, and also at such pursuits. New-chums
generally fell into, and were made
the subject of, numbers of practical jokes,
too, at the hands of these fellows, and I was
saved none the less in this respect. "Go
upstairs and get the bellows," one of them
said to me: and when I got to the top of
the stairs, some others sent me to the far
end of the ward for it. On arrival there,
another crowd met me with knotted handkerchiefs,
and 'pasted' me all the way back.
"Pricking a crow's nest," was another of
their games. This consisted in making a
round ring on the wall with a piece of
charcoal, and placing a black dot in the
centre of it. One was then blindfolded, and
his object was to place his finger on this
black dot; but instead of doing this, another
fellow stood with open mouth to receive the
finger, and he didn't forget to bite it either.
If anyone took money into this place they
might as well say 'au revoir' to it, for they
were not asleep. After a few days of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
life my trial came on&mdash;I was sentenced to
Australia for 7 years' penal servitude. Then
I was sent to Newgate, and when the door
opened there, I was met by a large number
of "Jack Shepherds," all in irons, and the
place was as dismal-looking as the grave.
First I entered the receiving-room, and
remained there a day; afterwards I was
put in with a fine assemblage of characters,
and one might as well begin to count the
stars in the Heavens as attempt to define
who was the worst individual there. Night
came on and I began to look around for a
bed; this I found consisted of a rug and a
mat, of which I availed myself. If a man
was sentenced to seven years he was only
kept there for a few days, and was then
taken in irons, by means of a van, to the
"hulk" at Portsmouth. This was the fate
I shared. On arrival there I was stripped
of my clothes, and after the barber came
round and cut my hair so close that it was
only with difficulty I could catch hold of it,
I was washed from two tubs of water which
stood close by. Then I was dressed in a
pair of knee breeches, stockings, shirt, and
a pair of shoes so large that I could have
almost crossed the Atlantic in them, and a
hat capable of weathering the greatest hurricane
that ever blew. Whilst on board the
hulk an old Jew paid several visits, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
purpose of buying up all the ordinary clothes
of the men, and no matter how new a suit
might be, it was either a matter of take half-a-crown
for it or throw it away. Fortunately,
my best clothes were left behind, and I lost
nothing by this.</p>

<p>I remained on the hulk from Friday till
Monday morning, and was then transferred
to what was known as the Bay Ship&mdash;the
"Hoogly"&mdash;by means of a cutter. There
were 260 prisoners on board this ship
altogether. Before leaving the hulk, the
irons worn in Australia were attached to
the legs, but these were removed on getting
to sea. Men, however, were branded all
over&mdash;shirt, trousers, and everything else.
The "Hoogly" left Portsmouth harbour
on the 28th July, 1834, and was 120 days
coming to Australia, and the passage on
the whole was not unfavorable. Four men,
however, were flogged during the passage
for misconduct. One of those on board was
transported for stealing articles from a
Roman Catholic Chapel, and he had by
some means managed to get a quantity of
tobacco into his possession. One night
whilst he was asleep some of the others
conspired to get this tobacco, and they put
his big toe into the bunghole of a cask. He
used to sleep on the tobacco, and as soon
as he sat up to release his toe the tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
was passed away through the crowd, and
that was the last he saw of it.</p>

<span class="subhead">Arrival at Sydney.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Settlement
at Sydney was now nearly 50 years old,
my impression on arriving there in the
summer of 1834 was anything but a bright
one, and by no means came up to my
faintest expectations. It was a scattered-looking
place&mdash;a house here and a terrace
there, but miserable enough to my mind.
After we had been in Sydney harbour a few
days, a number of officials came aboard the
ship, and, as if 'to the manner born,' took
a list of the marks on the men, who were
stripped to the waist. One of them, in
particular, had some writing on his arm,
and he was told that if it was not quickly
removed, he would get 50 lashes for it
when he reached shore, so he took the
advice. We remained aboard ship till three
days later, we were marched ashore in line,
four deep, a little after daylight, and taken to
Hyde Park Barracks. Here we got a beautiful
breakfast, "hominy," in little tubs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
At 2 o'clock the same day we were called
out to witness a punishment. There were
no "25's" there; all "50's" and "75's"&mdash;goodness
knows what the offenders had been
doing. After this, it was possible for any
one of us to be called out and sent to a
master. If a man had a seven years' sentence,
he had to serve four years with a master before
he got a "ticket-of-leave;" but if he happened
to prove himself a success at any
particular vocation, he would never get his
"ticket," as the master for whom he was
working would arrange with one of the other
servants to quarrel with the handy man, and
he would be sent to the lock-up to be flogged,
and get an addition to his sentence. If a
man was sentenced to 14 years, he had to
serve 6 years with a master before he got a
"ticket." All the master had to give a
servant in the year was 2 suits of clothes, 2
pairs of boots and a hat, also his food. The
latter was supposed to be either 3&frac12; lbs. of
maizemeal and 7 lbs. of flour, or 9 lbs. of beef
for the week.</p>

<p>My first assignment was to Mr. Sam Terry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
on his station at Mount Pleasant. Here I
had little or nothing to do, and this man
was a good master&mdash;he would never have his
men flogged. But I had the misfortune to
be stricken with the sandy blight at this
place, and I was sent to the Windsor Hospital,
where I remained for 10 months. From
here I was sent to Windsor Gaol, but
instead of a bed, I had to lie on a flag-stone,
which was not conducive to building up my
health. From Windsor I was transferred to
Parramatta, and eventually to the Barracks
again. Shortly after this, I was sent on to
that beautiful vessel known as the "Ph&#339;nix"
hulk&mdash;prison ship. This was the first occasion
on which I had the extreme pleasure of
meeting Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, the man who conspired
with two others to rob a house, and when
they were in the act of doing so, he
assailed them with a gun, fired and wounded
one of them as he came out of the window,
and secured his freedom for catching thieves.
This was a very cunning trick, as he arranged
the plot himself, and he afterwards became
prominent. I saw him shortly after this
took place, when he was assuming all sorts of
things, and I said "Hulloa! how are you
getting on?" He looked at me, and said,
"Why, I never saw you before, sir." "That'll
do," I said, "you forget that I saw you on
the "Ph&#339;nix" hulk, and don't try to put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
side before me." He said no more.</p>

<p>It was not long before my health had sufficiently
repaired to allow of my being sent
to Port Macquarie, and as this journey had
to be accomplished by water, the steamer
"Little Billy," (William the Fourth) came
into requisition. I left Sydney in this vessel
on Monday, and she reached her destination
on the following Sunday, after we had been
on deck the whole time tossing about. There
were a good number of us on board, and
sometimes we got tea, and more often we
didn't. We were inspected on arrival, and
afterwards landed at the barracks, which
stood on the water's edge against the river.
The first incident that came under my notice
on arrival was a lean, hungry-looking fellow
named "Nipper," going along with his head
down, apparently in a tit, until he reached
and hit up against a wall, then he fell on his
back like a cockroach&mdash;he was bloated out
nearly as large as a cask with "hominy."
Then I saw another man named "Larry"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
coming along; he was positively mad, for he
used to go along singing out "Larry! Larry!!
Larry!!!" This man was reputed to have
knocked his wife's brains out with a saucepan.
Still another I saw, who was called
"Captain." He had been a pirate, and used
to walk about the roofs of houses with a
piece of stick, using it as a telescope, and
giving orders. I heard him sing out "Chuck
us up that Jew &mdash;&mdash; to deal with," and I
don't know whom he meant, but it was quite
enough for me, so I left. Night came on, and
one of the men&mdash;Jack Sleet&mdash;had a few shillings
in his pocket. Some of the others heard
the money jingle, and needless to say he was
watched to bed, the money being placed
very safely underneath him. Everything
was quiet towards the middle of the night,
when suddenly we were all awakened by
hearing a man sing out, "Oh! h&mdash;&mdash;, Oh!
h&mdash;&mdash;, somebody's cut me." It transpired
that someone, in cutting the money from under
him, had forced the knife rather too much,
and it had entered his flesh, but the money
was gone all the same, and every one appeared
to be asleep.</p>

<p>When all the men retired to barracks at
night, it was so crowded that where to lie
down became a puzzle, and it was dirty
besides. Men still kept on coming from
Sydney, which made matters ten times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
worse. One day while in these quarters, I
was sent down to one of the wharves to help
unload a boat laden with produce. I worked
very hard all day, and it was late in the
evening before I returned to the barracks.
On arrival I asked the master's permission to
bake myself a "johnny cake" for supper.
In due course I had the cake mixed, and
placed it on the fire to cook in an old frying-pan
that was more "hol(e)y than righteous."
Seated beside the fire watching my cake, I
felt a nasty hit with a stick from behind, and
as there was no other weapon handy with
which to return the compliment, I grasped
the frying-pan by the handle, and, turning
round, brought it down full force on to my
assailant's head. Needless to say, his head
was harder than the bottom of the pan, and
the next thing I remember was seeing him
wriggling about with the hot pan on his neck,
and exclaiming, "Oh! my G&mdash;, this pan is
burning me!" Then a by-stander came up
with a bucket of water and poured it on him,
and afterwards the pan was removed. I
turned to him, and said; "The next time I
am at the fire perhaps you'll leave me alone."
But my feet hardly had time to touch the
ground before I was landed in the lock-up,
and the next day I was brought before the
court and sentenced to 36 lashes, and it
would have been "100" only that the overseer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
spoke up for me, and said that I was
quite justified in my action. But even "36"
was a fine cure for the "prickly heat." I
got full of this and ran away to the Green
Hills&mdash;15 miles distant&mdash;with a mate. When
we got there, it seemed that we were to get
no peace, for the aborigines came around us
with their "yabber," and it was but a short
time before they were off to the police and
informed them of our whereabouts. Two days
later we were caught, and I got "50" more
to "clench the bargain."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Doctors, in the practice of their profession,
not infrequently inform their patients that
there is an insufficiency of iron in their blood,
but no such assertion was ever known to be
made to a man who at any time occupied a
position in the Port Macquarie Iron Gang,
for if there was no iron in their blood there
should have been, if the "barking of shins"
went for anything. I was sent into this
gang, and amongst the men in it were a
number termed "specials." These "specials"
were sent out principally for forgery or
swindling, and many of them were so flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
that they used to look down upon the other
class of men, and try to play a game of
"bluff." I was boiling my billy of tea one
evening, when one of them came up and
threatened to do all sorts of things to me if I
did not remove my billy and allow him the
fire. "What do you want?" I asked. "I
want the fire," he replied. "Well," I said,
"you can have it when I am finished." He
took no notice of me, but persisted in removing
my billy and placing his own on the
fire. At last I quietly lifted his off, threw it
into the swamp, and gave him a good thrashing.
I was then removed, and got a little
peace.</p>

<p>Perhaps for a fortnight now I went to
work with the hand-cart, bringing firewood
for the Government officers, and finally
joined the iron gang again. Shortly after I
re-joined this gang a man named Arger, who
had been captain in a regiment, was attacked
by a fierce looking fellow named Lorrens,
who went up, and, drawing a knife, stabbed
Arger both sides of the neck and in the ribs,
then told him to "draw his sword and defend
himself." This man had not the slightest
provocation to commit such a murderous act,
as the poor fellow never did him the least
injury, and he was sent to Norfolk Island
for life.</p>

<p>Another man in the gang named Handersen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a carpenter, went up to a Frenchman
named Antonio, and knocked him down with
a hammer; then, turning round, he said:
"I killed that b&mdash;&mdash;, and I hope his soul
has gone wandering." These acts were
done principally for tobacco, or for half-a-loaf
of bread, (even in those days "half-a-loaf"
was considered to be better than "no
bread") and the object was generally to get
some of the flash "specials" a holiday to
Sydney in charge of a man, and this was
called "jeeing" them.</p>

<p>When a man received six or 12 months
in irons, he had to sleep on the floor with
one blanket, and a sleeper for a pillow; and
if he got ever so wet before going to bed in
rainy weather, he had to put on the same
wet clothes next morning.</p>

<p>There was another cowardly thing done
in the iron gang. A poor fellow named
Freeham was met by a member of the stone-breaking
party, who raised a hammer and
struck him in the jaw, breaking it. This
wretch got 12 months added to his former
sentence, but was afterwards sent to Sydney
on a charge of murder on his own word,
for killing a man at Ballengarra, situated
some miles up the river; but as there was
no evidence except his own, he was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
back to Port Macquarie for 12 months&mdash;though
he said that he would rather be
hanged than serve another 12 months in
such a place of slavery and trials; for out
of about 50 or 60 men, 14 or 15 of them
would be brought before the court every
week and punished, and they were all poor,
harmless men. The charge against them
was usually neglect or disobedience. Fancy
poor wretches, with chains hanging about
them being charged with neglect of work,
or even disobedience. Walking about in
chains was hard enough work without
carrying hand-carts full of earth, and who
could bring themselves to obey flash
"specials?"</p>

<p>One poor wretch got a month in the cells
on bread and water for having a piece of
writing paper in his pocket, and another
unfortunate fellow was sentenced to "100
lashes" for having a letter in his pocket
which he was endeavouring to send to a
friend. Still these officials went to Church,
offered up prayer (?) and aped religion.</p>

<p>Tom &mdash;&mdash; was sentenced to two months
on bread and water for running away; but
although Tom bolted he only went a little
way and brought himself to an anchor on a
farm, which he never left. He used to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
into a hollow tree in the day time, and,
opossum-like, come out at night and eat
the corn. Half-an-acre of this grain disappeared
in a fortnight, and then he gave
himself up, as there was no more corn to
eat. This man had great storage capacity,
as one Sunday morning I saw him eat
eight men's allowance for a ration of corn
bread whilst going a distance of about 200
yards. He was transported for taking a
man-o'-war boat, in company with five
others, and was a 7-year man. But he was
a fearful glutton, for his allowance of food
was no more satisfaction to him than a
straw is to a bottle. I remember one day,
returning from work, he saw a woman
lying drunk on the road, and he picked her
up, lifted her on to his shoulder, and ran
away into the bush with her. The Police
Magistrate who was in the vicinity, noticing
what was taking place, sang out, "Put
that woman down!" "If I do," said
Tom, "the d&mdash;&mdash; police will have her"
and he took no further notice, but continued
on his journey, and there was not a sign of
him till the next day. Then he was arrested
and locked up by the police, and
received 14 days on bread and water for his
trouble. When he came out he bore a half-starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
appearance&mdash;the bread and water
did not suit him.</p>

<p>About the year 1839 the gang had completed
the first road, and the lame, the
blind, and those with wooden legs were
furnished with a clean bed in honor of the
occasion. These cripples were employed
principally in taking goods to the settlers
without payment, and the poor wretches
often went short when their journey's end
was reached. When not employed, they
used to lounge about on the hills overlooking
the sea sunning themselves, and it was not
infrequent that they had quarrels amongst
themselves. Just picture to yourself a man
with wooden legs offering to "fight any
b&mdash;&mdash; man on timber" as they used to
put it. When these wooden-legged men
had a quarrel in a boat they sat on the
seats, with a man propped against the back
of each, and in this fashion they would
fight away in great style. I saw two of
them on one occasion fight till they could not
see each other. There were also one-armed
men amongst them; these were employed
in breaking stone, and they had a
Jew for a boss, who was also a wooden-legged
man. One day he went to sleep in
the sun on one of the hills above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
harbour, and another Jew named Lewis
collected a quantity of old maize stalks and
other fuel, and set fire to his wooden legs
whilst he was asleep. They were not
burning long, however, before he awoke and
found one to be shorter than the other;
and it was a sight for sore eyes to see him
walking down to the Old Broken Barracks,
singing out to everyone that he met&mdash;"That
Jew-looking b&mdash;&mdash; down there has
burnt my legs nearly off."</p>

<p>Just after this a poor fellow died in the
barracks. A coffin was made for him, and
his remains were being carried away for
interment by four of his fellow-prisoners.
After they had proceeded some little distance,
two of them had a quarrel, when
they threw the coffin down, and it burst, and
out rolled the corpse on to the ground.
They fought their quarrel out, and after
receiving satisfaction at each other's hands,
they picked the body and coffin up and carried
it back to the barracks, where it was
tacked together again, and four other men
were sent to bury it.</p>

<p>The making of roads in the streets of the
Settlement was now being actively proceeded
with, and in some instances the
hills which had to be cut through were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
steep that a man could not comfortably
ascend one of them without irons on his
legs, let alone with them&mdash;but the hills had
to be broken down by men with sore backs,
and if one man happened to collide with
another who had been recently flogged, it
would be&mdash;"Oh, G&mdash;&mdash;! mind my sore
back." These were hard times; hard worked
and half starved.</p>

<p>Six men once got "50" for refusing their
allowance of beef&mdash;it being of inferior
quality; but good meat was brought to
court when they were being tried, not the
kind that was refused. They were questioned,
"What have you to say?" but were
only allowed to get one word out when the
order would be "50." And so it appeared
to be "no use going to law with the Devil
when the court was held in H&mdash;&mdash;." Some
men seemed to have a harder skin than
others; a few would stand "50" like a piece
of wood; they would sooner die than allow
anyone to hear a groan. There was one
poor little fellow named Mick whom the
wretched overseer used to take a delight in
bringing before the court; he would never
pick out a flash-looking rascal, but only poor
men who could just crawl about.</p>

<p>I remember one terrible schemer who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
into the gang. He met Mr. &mdash;&mdash; one
morning, and said, "If you do not give me
five 'bob' I'll lay a charge against you for
buying rations off the Government men."
He was thereupon caught by the collar and
taken off to the watchhouse, and was sentenced
to two months in the iron gang. It
was about 11 o'clock in the day when he
came into the gang, and that evening he got
"50" for doing something. The next
day he tried the same dodge, but was
walked off again and got another "50."
The third day he went up to the overseer
and said: "Do you expect me to work after
the flogging I got yesterday?" The answer was
a smack with a big stick. He was compelled
to go to work with the other men, dragging
hand-carts full of earth. There were three
men to each cart, and a soldier always accompanied
the men to keep them from running
away or receiving tobacco, as if any of the
weed were found on a man he would get
"50." No spoons, knives, or forks were
allowed men in the iron gang, for if they had
them they would stab each other. Some
used to eat their "hominy" with a piece of
iron hoop, which they used as a spade-scraper.
Others used a piece of bone. One fellow had
a hat with a double-crown, and he used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
secrete tobacco and other things in it. The
overseer once picked this hat up and said to
him: "You have a hat with two crowns."
"Yes," he replied, "It's a good job you
have nothing in it to-day," added the overseer.
And so it was, for if there had been it
would have meant trouble. Some of the
men used to watch the boss, and scheme
when his back was turned; but if he caught
any of them they were sure of "50," for he
never said a word&mdash;only just held up a
stick and a policeman would come to the
rescue.</p>

<p>Every Sunday the men got a small piece of
soap with which to wash their clothes, and if
rain happened to come on whilst they were
doing it, orders were given to just gather up
the clothes, and, wet or dry, they were
brought into the room. These clothes then
had to be worn to church by the men, who
were safeguarded by a tyrannous overseer
and a soldier: and there they sat listening to
a minister preach, and looking at the hard-hearted
wretches who were ruling them. If
the men had got something to eat, it would
have done them more good than hearing
about the next world, for they thought very
little about religion in their sad state.</p>

<p>Poor &mdash;&mdash; was sentenced to 12<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
months in the chain gang for running away,
and he was only in the gang two days when
the overseer brought him to court and got
him "50." He then took the sulks, and
would neither work nor eat. Then he was
handcuffed and dragged up and down the
street till some of the more tender-hearted
officials could stand it no longer; and he
was eventually chained to a bed-post, where
he lay down, like an over-worked ox, and
died. It was the custom to chain men to
their bed when they became sick and were
sent to the hospital, for fear that they would
run away in the night. One man did bolt
at night, and was not heard of again, the
supposition being that he perished in the
bush. This was a fine man, too, and once
belonged to the Life Guards in London.</p>

<p>I was amongst a batch of men who were
once marched down from the barracks to
assist in unloading a little vessel&mdash;the
"Waterwitch"&mdash;laden with corn, which had
become wrecked whilst crossing the bar. We
worked all day and were brought back at
night, receiving cornmeal and water for our
supper. All our clothes were wet, and we
had either to sleep in them or else lie on the
floor with nothing. Such was life in the
iron gang.</p>

<span class="subhead">Assigned to Lake Innes.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Double, double toil and trouble,"</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Shortly after Port Macquarie was made a
Penal Settlement, several men of considerable
wealth visited and settled in the district, and
were granted large areas of land in and
around the Settlement. Amongst these was
Major Innes, who became the possessor of a
large area of land about six miles from the
town, which was and is known as Lake
Innes. On this property the "Major" built
a beautiful residence, with all the conveniences
that money could command. It was
not long before he commenced to breed
horses for the Indian market, and frequently
sent shipments of valuable horses to India.
Besides this, he occupied large stores in the
Settlement, and used to contract with the
Government for supplying soldiers and men
with provisions. A man of the "Major's"
calibre could, by applying, get numbers of
what were termed "assigned servants" to
work on his property, and of this labour he
availed himself to a great extent.</p>

<p>In the year 1838 I and two others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
sent to Lake Innes to dig water holes for
cattle, the seasons being so dry at the time
that water had become a scarcity. We dug
drains through the swamps, and made provision
for ample water for the famishing
cattle. Slopes were also made leading into
the drains, so that any cattle which fell into
the water, and were too weak to get out
themselves, could be pulled out. One day,
while there, the boss came down to see how
we were progressing with the work, and after
a while one of us said to him: "You ought
to allow us a little more tea and sugar, for
this is hard work; to say nothing of being
up to our knees in water all day."</p>

<p>"Go on with your work," he said, "I
think a good flogging would do you more
good than tea and sugar. Did you get tea
and sugar in the road party?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but we had not to work in the
water; and we left off work at 3 o'clock to
cook our food, but here we have to work till
6." At this he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards I pretended to be
sick, and went up to the overseer and said:
"I want a pass for the hospital."</p>

<p>"I can't give you one," he replied, "but
if you'll bring up a pot I'll give you some
castor-oil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>I went down to the hut and brought up
the "Royal George"&mdash;the big pot that we
used to cook in, laid it at the door and sang
out.</p>

<p>The overseer came out, and seeing the pot,
asked, "What the devil did you bring that
for?"</p>

<p>"That's the only pot I can find," I said,
"except what we make our tea in, and I
could not put oil in that." Then he gave me
some oil in a bottle. He came down the
next day to see if the oil had done me any
good. I told him that it had, but it was a
fowl that I had the night before that did me
good, for I went about with my eyes open
and knew where they roosted&mdash;in the castor
oil bushes. I did not want oiling like a
steam engine.</p>

<p>Rain now came, and we relinquished the
drain-digging; I was then sent into the
vegetable garden to work. I was there but
a very short time when the milkman lost his
billet, and I succeeded him in that position.
This job did not suit me; all the other men
were comfortable in huts, and I was stuck,
out in the milk yard in all sorts of weather,
knee-deep in muck, as well as being growled
at by the other men if I did not let them
take the milk. It was a bad job for a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
if he were caught at anything like this, and at
the very least it meant "50." I was in
great dread, as I had to please the men by
letting them take the milk, and I also had to
please the master by preventing them. One
morning I hit upon a plan to get out of this
billet. It was raining very heavily this
morning, and I was wet through. When I
had finished milking I dipped my hands into
the muck in the yard, and then into the milk,
carried it up to the house, and gave it to the
butler. He looked at me for a second, then
at the milk, and said, "You d&mdash;&mdash;, dirty
brute! Whom do you think can drink that
milk?" "Well, I can't help it," I said,
"look at the yard, up to my knees in filth,
and the boss won't give me time to clean it
out." "Then you shall not milk any more,"
said the butler.</p>

<p>I was laughing up my sleeve to think how
well I had done the business. They put
another milkman on, but he soon went to the
hospital with pains in his legs. A third man
was put on, and after a few days he was
recalled to help make bricks, so the old
milkman was then engaged, and that ended
the trouble.</p>

<p>One morning the signal bell pealed out,
and all the men had to go up and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
they were wanted for. There was a terrific
storm raging, and we were told that we had
to cut wood for the dining-room and parlour
fires, but not one would stand out in such
weather to do the work. We went to the
boss and told him that we would cut the
firewood as soon as the storm was over.
"How often am I out in the rain?" he said,
"it won't melt you&mdash;you're not sugar."
Turning to the overseer, he ordered us to be
put on Government rations, and we were
then the recipients of 7 lbs. of flour, 3&frac12; lbs. of
cornmeal, and 7 lbs. of meat&mdash;what the men
used to call "staggering bob"&mdash;in the week.
Saturday came&mdash;ration day&mdash;and I went up
for my allowance as usual; but when it
came to the donation of meat, I was shown a
large piece of bone with a small piece of
meat attached to it. "Is that what I am
going to get?" I asked. "Yes," replied the
overseer, "and if you don't like it, leave it!"
I left it, declaring to myself to have
some more of the fowls and turkeys out
of the castor-oil bushes. Two nights
passed; the third was showery, and
very convenient for the job; it was also very
dark. I armed myself with a bag, and proceeded
up to where they used to roost. My
bag was soon half-full of poultry, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of them were cooked and eaten in double-quick
time, for the others had onions out of
the vegetable garden cooking while I was
away. The remainder of the poultry, not
eaten that night, was hidden in the swamp
and eaten as required. It was very convenient
to have the vegetable garden handy, and
the gardener had just planted out a hundredweight
of onions, but when he went to see
how they were growing there were but very
few left. This was the only way to cure
hunger after a day's toil. One night about a
week afterwards I went up to the castor-oil
trees for another pair of fowls, and who
should I see on the other side of the bushes
but &mdash;&mdash;, the constable, helping himself to
a fowl also. I did not have to wait long, for
he soon got his, and then the coast was clear,
so I got mine and departed. The constable
was looked upon as a very honest fellow, but
he was caught at last taking two sacks of
flour and some other provisions, and 12
months in irons was his lot. At this time it
took as much material to make a pair of
trousers for him as would make two pairs for
an ordinary man, and when his hair was cut
and his whiskers shaven, he looked like a
"mountain in a fog." But the hard boards
and one blanket, with only a sleeper for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
pillow, soon told on him, for in less than
three months, after good doses of "hominy"
and the pick, he became as thin as a whipping
post, although he was fortunate enough
to escape without a flogging. Some men had
wonderful luck in this way; the greatest
rogue generally got off the lightest.</p>

<p>About half-a-dozen men were assembled in
the shoemaker's shop one day, and the conversation
drifted on to persons who were
living in a state of adultery. "Now we will
count," said the shoemaker to the boys, "all
the people about here who are living in a
state of adultery." "And we will commence,"
said another, "with you and your
mother. Let me see, how many more has
she got besides you, Harry?" This was a
hit for a start, and poor Harry walked out
of the shop as if he had committed a murder.
After this there was no more talk about
people living on the cross.</p>

<p>Flour at this time was &pound;10 per 200 lb.
sack, and, as it was so scarce, Sir George
Gipps, the Governor, recommended that those
who had the supplying of provisions for the
prisoners should grind rice and mix it with
the flour. This course was adopted, but
when it was baked the loaf resembled a
brick outside and a piece of clay inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The meat was horrible. This, however,
could not be remedied, as there was no feed
for the cattle; and as for mutton&mdash;when a
sheep was skinned and dressed, if a candle
were put inside of the carcase it would serve
all the purposes of a lantern.</p>

<p>There was a screw loose at Lake Innes
one morning; the store containing the provisions
had been broken into and robbed.
All the men's huts were searched&mdash;even
the floors taken up&mdash;trying to get the slightest
clue to the robbery. The police were
busy as bees, but they could not get the
least hint. The value of the stolen goods
was estimated at &pound;50, and they comprised
a good assortment of the various household
requisites. The Port Macquarie police were
sent for, and the boss flung about first in
one place and then in another. At last
the bell rang, and all hands had to stand
out before the "Lord of the Lake." It was
a real field day&mdash;men strutting about as
though in a field of battle. The boss offered
sums of money to anyone who would tell
who the robbers were, for he said that no
rascal could do it single-handed. At last
two suspects were picked out and sent to
the lock-up, but they returned in a week, as
no case could be got against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>About three weeks afterwards I was at
work with the pick and shovel, making a
road down to the boat-house, for there were
pleasure boats on the Lake. The constable
came down to me, and said: "Ah! my
boy, I've got you and &mdash;&mdash;, now; it was
you two who robbed the store, and now you
will have to pay for it. You were seen at
the head of the tree where the bag of sugar
was found." I told him that I had no hand
in robbing the store, but I was marched up
to the house before the boss, who said: "So
you are one of the scoundrels who broke
into the store and stole all that you could
get your hands on, and I'll make it a bad
job for you and that other scoundrel. I
will teach you a lesson this time, you
thieving dogs!"</p>

<p>Who should I see there, however, but
the man that should have been at work
with me, and another fellow. They had
just gone up to the house and informed that
I was a culprit. One of these two was to
get his freedom a few days later, and he
evidently thought that &pound;5 reward would be
very nice to have a spree on, no matter
what an innocent man might suffer. The
other man and I were taken to Port
Macquarie in a cart, and brought before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Bench. The informer was as deaf as a
post, but the magistrate said that although
the man could not hear him, he could tell
what he said by the quiver of the magistrate's
lips. And so we got six months
added to our former sentence.</p>

<p>On Sundays church was held at the
Lake, and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; used to preach. I
was sent for one morning to go to church,
so I blackened myself and went up without
a shirt. The boss met me on the way up,
and asked, "Where are you going to?"
"Well," I said, "I'm going to chapel."
"Do you think you are going to chapel
without a shirt?" he continued. "My
shirt is out on the fence drying," I answered.
"Then go on back again, and don't come up
in that plight any more." This was all
I wanted; the church did not trouble me.</p>

<p>During my term here my eyesight became
bad again&mdash;it never had been very
good from the time that I had sandy blight
some years before&mdash;and it got that way at
last that it was almost impossible for me to
see. The life there was not improving it,
either, so I informed the boss, and after a
little conversation he gave me two letters&mdash;one
to the Police Magistrate in the town,
and the other to the doctor. I started off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
with the letters, not knowing what was in
them, for my sight was too bad to read;
but on the way in I met someone who could,
and soon got over the difficulty. The letter
to the P.M. came first, and ran thus:
"Dear &mdash;&mdash;, Inflict some severe punishment
on this man and return him to me at
once, for I cannot get him to work." The
other one to the doctor was just asking him
to have a look at my eyes, and do what he
could to them. Now it was not very likely
that I was going to take a note to the
Magistrate to perhaps get "50" over it, so
without hesitation I tore it up, and went
down to the doctor, whom I did not fear,
and knew to be a good man. He read the
letter, looked at my eyes, and then said:
"Well, if you want to see you can; and if
you don't want to see you can go about with
the blind mob." So I decided to give the
"blind mob" a trial.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1847, Governor and Lady
Fitzroy visited Port Macquarie, and were the
guests of Major Innes at the Lake. When
the steamer by which they travelled arrived
at the wharf, there were two rows of
soldiers drawn up on each side of the road
leading from it, and waiting a little distance
away was the carriage of the "Major," with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
six horses in it&mdash;two bays, two grays, and two
chestnuts&mdash;and the distinguished visitors
were driven straight away to the Lake.
There was high life at this place now for
about a month&mdash;balls, parties, pic-nics, &amp;c.&mdash;when
they returned to Sydney again. But
it was the Governor's misfortune to lose his
good lady soon afterwards, for she was killed
through a carriage accident in Parramatta
Park in December of the same year.</p>

<p>The day after the doctor told me that I
could go with the "blind mob," I joined
them. These blind people used to carry on
a little gardening and other occupations,
such as the blind were suited for. And
goodness knows what they were not suited
for&mdash;they could play cards, dice, toss, and
all sorts and conditions of things.</p>

<p>I had not been in the camp ten minutes
before a notorious character, named "Teddy,"
came up and said to me: "Come on, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
on, we will go and 'shake' some melons!"
"Where abouts?" I inquired. "Oh! I'll
show you," he answered, "out on the Glebe."
Just fancy a man as "blind as a bat" asking
me to go stealing melons. "No," I said,
"I'm not going to get into any trouble over
melons," and he called me all the crawling
hounds and scoundrels that he could think
of. Shortly afterwards he said to me, "Do
you ever kill snakes?" "Not often," I
said; "Why, what do you want to know
that for?" "Well," he returned, "I want
to get a snake's head to put teeth upwards
in the overseer's boot&mdash;I'll do for him yet."
I told him to be careful, or he would pull up
on the scaffold.</p>

<p>I soon found out that I had got amongst
the biggest lot of thieves and robbers in the
place. I became possessed of a few pence,
and they knew it. That night I retired, as
usual, and put my trousers under my head.
As soon as things were quiet the trousers
were eased from under my head. I knew it
but said nothing, and as soon as they found
there was no money in them, back came the
pants. I came from London as well as they
did, and the money was hidden in a place
that they dreamt not of.</p>

<p>This was quite enough of the "blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mob" for me. The next day at dinner time
I went up to the boss and told him I would
rather go into the road party than stay with
thieves.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Road Parties.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"More sinned against than sinning."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>When a man had finished his sentence in
the chain gang, he was sentenced to a road
party, and it was Heaven to the chain gang.
There was not so much slavery, and it was
possible to get a sort of bed to lie down on
at night, if it were only a sheet of ti-tree
bark. The men got a little more food, too,
and they were allowed to cook it themselves;
but it was often a straggling piece of meat
with about as much fat on it as would grease
the eye of a packing-needle. One man always
remained to mind the camp while the others
were at work, and very often he used to do
what was known as "weeding"&mdash;that was,
taking a little out of each man's allowance
of provisions, and then he had a little to sell
and get money to buy himself some tea and
sugar. But one of them went too far at
this game at last and was caught; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
there was a fearful uproar. The overseer
was going to take him to court straight away,
but the other men said they would rather
settle it amongst themselves, and this they
did by each man giving him three blows on
the back with a knotted handkerchief; for
if he had been taken to court, he was almost
certain to get six months in irons, as the
authorities did not believe in the men robbing
one another of their food. I gave him
three good hits, and the handkerchief used
to rebound like India-rubber.</p>

<p>In the road party it was a funny sight to
see some of the flash "specials" using a cross-cut
saw. Their hands were very soft, and
they used to tie pieces of old shirts round
the handles at each end to protect them.
They generally liked a saw that would
'pinch,' so that they would have an excuse
to go to the camp for a maul and wedges to
drive into the cut and prevent the pinching;
thus they schemed and wasted their time.
In the middle of work I often heard them
commence to talk about the fine wine they
had drank at some of the big inns in London&mdash;"The
Angel at Islington," "The Hole in
the Wall," or "The Elephant and Castle,"
for instance, and some of them had never
tasted wine in their lives. At night they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
began to 'blow' about how they had done
some of the honest merchants in England out
of large and small sums of money; but it
was a different tale now&mdash;they saw very
little money in the road party.</p>

<p>But some of them had fine times of it
during one boss's term of office, for he did
not abuse them. It was different when old
Major S&mdash;&mdash; came along to inspect them.
He came along once while I was there, and
said to one fellow, "Hulloa! what did you
get sent out for?" "Forgery on Mr. So and
So," was the answer. "Dear me! he's a
particular friend of mine. Here, constable,
take the tail off his coat and brand him all
over."</p>

<p>The constable then cut the tail of his coat
close off around the waist and branded him
all over, leaving such a smell of paint from
the brands that the flies would keep off him
for a good many days afterwards.</p>

<p>Proceeding further the overseer pulled
another fellow up&mdash;"And what was your
occupation at home, and how came you to be
sent out here?" "I was a schoolmaster,
and was sent out for embezzlement," he
answered. "A fine fellow to teach scholars
how to rob people. Here, constable, take
and brand him," and he shared the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fate.</p>

<p>A third fellow, in answer to a similar
question, said, "I used to drive my carriage
and four at home, sir." "Then you will
drive a wheelbarrow and one out here!" He
was branded, too.</p>

<p>They looked first-class with a pick and
shovel, and at making a damper&mdash;they had
no more idea of this than a kangaroo. Some
of them frequently said that they were well
off in England, and yet they were the
greatest villains under the sun. If a man
were possessed of any little thing out of the
common they tried all sorts of plans to get it
from him, and if unsuccessful by fair means,
they would steal it from him. Every man
had to do his own washing, and these "specials"
would rub away at their duck pants
with a piece of soap about the size of a halfpenny.
The soap was something like the
sugar they got for their "hominy"&mdash;it was
visible, and that was all.</p>

<p>The Police Magistrate came along once
and heard one of the party pass a remark
which he did not like, so he said, "Jack, if
I could find a man to give you 50 lashes, you
would get it." Up sprang a short fellow,
named Ned &mdash;&mdash;, and exclaimed, "I will
give it to him for you; if you'll promise me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
he won't have the satisfaction of flogging me
afterwards."</p>

<p>"I promise you he will not have that
privilege," said the P.M.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Ned, "I'm in office."</p>

<p>He got Jack on the "three-legged mare,"
as they used to call it, and started flogging.</p>

<p>Jack sang out, "You're not hitting me
properly."</p>

<p>"I'm doing my best to please you," he
said, "so you must take it as it comes."</p>

<p>He gave him another lash and said,
"There, does that please you?"</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"My G&mdash;&mdash;," he said, "it seems you're
hard to please, but you will have to take it
as well as I can give it to you."</p>

<p>This Jack was a well-educated man, and a
frightful rogue into the bargain; for if he
got a man drunk he would pick his pocket
and then take him to the lock-up afterwards.</p>

<p>The chief constable said to him one day,
"Jack, the men tell me that you rob them."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I might as well have the money
as them; for they only kill themselves with
drink and put the Government to more
expense."</p>

<p>As soon as this man got free, he went
home to his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Major &mdash;&mdash; was hard on these
"specials;" if they did the least thing it meant
"50," and he would sing out to the flogger,
"Tip it into him," and afterwards they were
sent to a road party.</p>

<p>Two blind men were brought before him
one day on a small charge, and he asked,
"What have you two to say for yourselves?"
Their reply was the throwing of two half-bricks
at him, and one struck him above the
eye. For this they were committed for
trial, and afterwards sentenced to three
years at Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>H&mdash;&mdash; was the name of one of these
"specials," and when using the spade he
stood as upright as a yard of pump-water;
but when the overseer spoke to him, he had
the appearance of a goose looking down a
bottle. When this fellow became free, he
went to Sydney, and used to walk about with
a gold-headed cane selling eye-lotion.</p>

<p>Most of the "specials" were merely clerks
and were sent to this Settlement so that they
would not be able to write home and tell how
things were going on. They appeared to just
do as they liked with those who were under
them. If a man did not put his hand to his
hat when passing of the bosses, and pay
them what was termed "respect," he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
liable to "50;" if he gave any of them a
sharp answer he was sure of "50," and if he
said nothing at all, it was considered to be
"silent contempt," and this meant the same
"50," so a man might as well do something
as be punished for nothing. This is how
men who had to work for them were treated.
It was a singular thing, however, that not
one of these bosses died worth as much
money as they could "jingle on a tombstone."</p>

<p>The worst wretches that a man could be
put to work under were those who had been
sent to the country themselves. They were
far worse than men who came out free, and
how men put up with the tyranny of these
brutes is far beyond my conception.</p>

<p>In those days there were very few guns
procurable, and it was a rare thing to see
even an old flint musket. Pat &mdash;&mdash; was
ordered to get "50" every morning for a
week for taking to the bush with one of
these muskets. He begged of the boss to let
him have the whole week's flogging at once,
and so he got it. This old brute used to
glory in seeing a man being literally chopped
to pieces, and stood by, saying, "Tip it into
him!"</p>

<p>The bosses in these road parties were often
men with wooden legs, and were put over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
these men as they were considered unfit for
any other purpose. If annoyed, they
thought nothing of taking a stick&mdash;sometimes
their wooden legs&mdash;and striking the
men with them. One noted cripple turned
on me one morning, but I retaliated with
an axe-handle, and gave him a good thrashing.
After this I bolted, but was caught a
few days afterwards, and received 12 months
in irons for my trouble. I could not put up
with hard work, and be knocked about by a
hopping dog of a man as well.</p>

<p>These cripples were only allowed a few
men to gather shells, cut bridle tracks for
them, and so on, in remuneration for their
labor as overseers; but a man like H&mdash;&mdash;,
the notorious overseer, got 3s 3d per day, his
rations, a hut-keeper to cook for him, and
another man to get wood and water. These
fools would almost stand the flesh being cut
off their bones rather than lose their billets.</p>

<p>One mean-looking fellow in the road party
was sent to this country for obtaining money
under the garb of a priest, and there was one
poor simple Irishman in the gang from whom
he used to get flour on the pretence that
he would give him his blessing. But it was
the flour he was blessing&mdash;not poor O'Brady.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most gentlemanly and refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
man in the gang was a tall and stately fellow
named R&mdash;&mdash;, who was a great friend of
the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. This poor wretch was
to be pitied. He used to go about with
two old caps tied up round his feet for shoes,
and his 1lb. of "staggering bob," when
cooked and eaten, was almost as nothing
to him by way of checking hunger. On
more than one occasion he walked to Kathie
Creek&mdash;10 miles along the sea-beach south
from the Settlement&mdash;and there he got a
meal of 'clams' or 'cockles;' he would also
bring some back to the camp with him. The
times were hard on a man of this kind,
especially when he would walk 10 miles for
a feed; but hunger was a sharp thorn, and
"as a man's bed was made he had to lie on
it."</p>

<p>There was another fine-looking man in the
gang, but he was a terrible villain, and it
was supposed that he murdered a man not
far from the Settlement. Afterwards he
went to Sydney and there met his doom,
which was to be hanged for another murder,
and thus ended his career.</p>

<p>Port Macquarie seemed to be a depot for
rogues and villains such as these, for there
were some noted scoundrels amongst them.
The friend of a fellow named T&mdash;&mdash; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
doing some thieving once, and he gave
T&mdash;&mdash; a box to mind, which was supposed
to contain the stolen goods, until the robbery
blew over. But T&mdash;&mdash; felt the weight of
the box, and thought there was something
wrong, so he opened it, and instead of finding
the different articles, it was full of brickbats.
T&mdash;&mdash; then went and informed, and got
the thief 7 years. He always passed as
"Brickbat T&mdash;&mdash;" after that, and left
Port Macquarie for the goldfields near
Bathurst about the year 1851; so a very
handy man to mind anything was lost.</p>

<p>Some of these fellows were made constables
in one boss's time, but when a change occurred
and another boss came, they were sent to the
roads to work with a pick and shovel. And
fine specimens they were at work, too; it
took them nearly all their time to look at
the blisters on their hands. Some of them
appeared to have been brought up well,
though, and one of these was Harry &mdash;&mdash;,
a noted highwayman. This man had no
nose; some said that he cut if off to avoid
recognition, others said that it was bitten off
by an assailant. However, he had a silver
nose, and if he happened to lose it, had to go
without till a new one came from Sydney.
There was a road party at work about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
miles out of the town and one day Harry
came riding along on his favourite mare
"Biddy." On nearing the camp the
mare took charge of him and bolted,
and in the confusion that ensued, his
nose fell off. He went some distance
before the animal got controllable; then
he came back and asked the road party's
assistance to look for the silver "snozzle."
After they had been looking a while, an old
black crow arose from amongst the ferns with
something (presumably a grub) in its beak.
One and all then declared that this was his
silver snout the bird had, and at this Harry
got in a fearful rage and went off on his horse
without a nose at all. He was not a bad-hearted
man to his fellow prisoners,
though; he would not send them to the
lock-up, but rather advise them to keep
out and escape the punishment that invariably
followed.</p>

<p>A prominent figure in the Settlement in
those days was a man named H&mdash;&mdash;, who
was sent to the country for forging a will to
rob his orphan niece and nephew out of their
property; and a poor miserable player he
looked, carrying the "hominy" about on his
head. But finally he got out of the Government,
and his family came to the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and started business. After this he got on
well, and one of his daughters married to advantage.
The man whom this girl became
the wife of was, however, an obstinate fellow,
and if everything did not go his way, there
was always trouble. He was expecting his
father to die, and frequently went to the post
office in anticipation of news to that effect,
but when he did not get a letter, he used to
say: "My G&mdash;! how much longer is that
old wretch going to live?" At last the poor
old fellow did "shuffle off," and, although he
had comfortable means, he did not leave the
son a penny, only some tools. H&mdash;&mdash; was a
wide-awake old fellow, and at one time had a
boot and tannery business; but he had a man
working for him who was equally wide awake.
This fellow used to cut hides down the back,
and take strips out of them wide enough to
make soles for boots or shoes. He was
caught at last, however, and received two
months in the iron gang. After this he returned
to his old master. One day, not long
afterwards, the boss went out, and this fellow
was making a pair of boots for sale on the
sly. When the boss returned, he popped in
rather suddenly, and only for the presence of
mind of his employer, a bowl out was certain.
In a second he threw himself on the floor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
pretended to be in a fit. The boss walked in,
and, seeing him, immediately went for help&mdash;not
noticing the boots he was working at or
anything else. As soon as the boss made
his exit, he got up, hid the boots he was
working at, and put another pair in their
place; and on the master's return, he was
just coming out of the fit, and soon got alright.
This man got on well afterwards in
the Settlement.</p>

<p>The notorious "special," H&mdash;&mdash;, brought
twelve men to court one day for neglect of
work, but Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, the Police Magistrate,
said that he and another gentleman had been
looking at the poor men at work, and they
could not understand how men ran down the
slopes where they were making the road
without falling, more especially in irons; they
looked as if they were worked to death, and
he could not see in what way it would be
possible for them to neglect their work.
From the appearance of them, he thought
something to eat would do them more good
than a flogging. Then, turning to the notorious
H&mdash;&mdash;, he said; "You are a prisoner
yourself, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Worship," he answered.</p>

<p>The P. M.: "I thought so; you get so
much a day for bossing the men?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied H&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The P. M.: "Take them away, and don't
bring them before me again on such a
charge!"</p>

<p>The men turned to the Magistrate and
thanked him. They told him it was only
tyranny, and said it was a wonder how they
escaped without broken limbs, running down
such hills with loaded carts behind them.</p>

<p>This put an end to flogging, for the residents
of the town commenced to talk about
it. But the place did not seem to thrive,
for as soon as the Government men had gone,
and no more were coming, things were on a
downward move. There was no more convict
labor; no more fashionable balls and
parties; no more cases of wines, spirits, and
beers&mdash;nay, it was all bread, meat, and tea,
and lucky these tyrannous wretches were if
they could get that, for they had to "look
ere they leaped" too far, lest they should fall.</p>

<p>Some of the flash officials lived at the rate
of about &pound;500 a year, but as soon as the
prisoners were removed their harvest was
finished, and it was as much as they could
do to keep the bailiff out. It was not, "Go
on, you rascal, or I'll take you to court,"
then; but if they wanted a man to work they
had to pay him wages. And although employers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
were supposed to pay men wages,
they soon adopted another method of doing
them out of their earnings. This was done
by hiring men for six months, and, just before
their term had expired, find some fault
with them, take them to court, and get
their agreement cancelled and their pay
stopped. So it will be seen that use had
bred such habits in them that it was hard
to discontinue bringing the men to court.
However, this did not bring back the beer
and wine; a store account would soon be
upon them for the necessaries of life, and if
this were not paid within a reasonable time
there would soon be a bailiff from Sydney.
Thus they found out the loss of the poor
prisoners, whom they treated worse than
most men treat a dog, and it eventually
ended in selling off their cattle and horses
for what they would bring.</p>

<span class="subhead">"Specials" and Others.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>It was not often that any of the
"Specials" were sent out to work as farm
labourers, because they were suited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
anything but hard work; so they were generally
made constables. Conspicuous
amongst these was a man named Fred &mdash;&mdash;,
who, it was said, forged the largest
cheque which had been forged on the Bank
of England up to that time. This was a
well-educated man. He could read and
write French, Spanish, and Portuguese, and
had once been interpreter for the Court of
India. He had not been in the country
long before forgery commenced to worry
him again. For this, a sentence of two
years in the Port Macquarie Iron Gang was
given him, and he became the worst man
in it, for he fretted. When a man gave
way to the hardship, he became the victim
of insects, and this was the case with him.
Small wonder at any man giving way to
the hardship in such a place, for it was
nothing but hard work, hunger, and flogging,
the floor to sleep on, and one blanket
as a covering. After this man had finished
his two years in the Iron Gang, he was sent
to a road party for about six months, and
then became a constable on a salary of 3s
3d per day. While a constable he wrote
to his father, who was a shareholder in a
coal mine at Newcastle-on-Tyne, England,
and received a reply to the effect that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
could get good characters from the Police
Magistrate and a clergyman, he would endeavour
to get him his freedom. Besides
this, his father sent him &pound;1 per week, which
with his salary, amounted to nearly &pound;2
weekly; but here the pen and ink was introduced
again, and he forged the very man's
name who was paying him the &pound;1 per
week. He was then locked up, tried, and
committed, finally being sentenced to Norfolk
Island for life. This ended his career
in Port Macquarie.</p>

<p>Punishment appeared to be no warning
to some of these men, and it seemed that
'just as the twig was bent, the tree inclined.'
The misery that this fellow suffered the
second time he was committed should have
been quite sufficient, for most of those who
had a taste of the Iron Gang did not return
to it any more. It must have been
severe when the authorities sent Charles
&mdash;&mdash; from Sydney into the Gang for 12
months, as punishment for the murder of
M&mdash;&mdash;, on the Hunter River, and afterwards
burning him to ashes. In this case
there was no evidence except the murderer's
own word, but they declined to hang him
on that, both in this country and in
England. He was as quiet as a sheep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Gang, but, notwithstanding this fact,
the boss took good care to keep out of his
way.</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash; was a Jew, and a very old hand
in the country. Originally he was sent to
Moreton Bay, but having found Captain
&mdash;&mdash;, who was killed by the blacks
there, he was shifted to Sydney, and was
practically a free man at that place. But
he could not keep out of trouble, and for an
offence was sent to a road party in Port
Macquarie, from which he did not get his
liberty for about 22 years, and when it did
come, the news was too late. He was
working in a party on the road leading from
the coast to the table-land (the New England
Road) when his ticket-of-leave became due,
but a few minutes before the news of his
freedom arrived, he was killed by a log
rolling on him, and was buried in the vicinity
of the camp. His fellow-workmen cut a
stone and erected it on his grave, as he was
very much liked by all the men on the road,
but someone afterwards removed the stone
and used it for grinding purposes. Every
day, as soon as this poor fellow had finished
his work, he would retire to his bunk and
sit with a needle and thread making cabbage-tree
hats. These hats were always saleable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and making them was the only means by
which a man could earn a few pence to buy
tea, sugar, and tobacco.</p>

<p>Tom P&mdash;&mdash; was one of the first men
sent to Port Macquarie when it was made
a Settlement, and he was a most peculiar
individual. Pigs seemed to be his whole
existence, for he appeared to love these
animals. He possessed some 'grunters'
nine or ten years old, besides cattle and
horses. Tom used to sleep with the pigs,
and even with this precaution against
thieves it was not infrequent that he lost
one. Teddy H&mdash;&mdash; went out to Tom's
abode one night and stole a pig. When he
returned another fellow went for one.
While the second thief was in the act, however,
of getting his pig, Tom sat up amongst
them, and said, "How many more of you
are coming to-night?" But they earned
these pigs, for they had to carry them about
a mile. Anyone who saw Teddy the next
morning after this could swear that he had
made a rise&mdash;for he had such a corporation&mdash;and
it was then a password among the men,
"Hulloa! Teddy made a rise last night."
Then they said to Teddy, "Have you got
any more for to-morrow, Ted? Perhaps you
could give us a leg!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go for it yourselves, you crawling
hounds," he returned, "and chance it. I'm
not going to shake it and give it to you fellows
that are frightened of your own shadows.
If they grab me I must put up with it like
the rest of you."</p>

<p>Then they used to say to him, "Have you
got any cabbage or spuds to sell, Teddy? We
want some onions, too!"</p>

<p>This was how they questioned him, because
he had robbed a garden, and was proved
guilty by the police smelling the onions in
his breath. So poor Teddy got "50" on
what was termed the "Broad Bean Racket"
(robbing a garden). But what did these men
care? If there was a garden handy, "50"
or no "50" they would be into it, as they
never got any vegetables except by stealing.
They were merry as crickets, too, when they
had had a good 'blow out.'</p>

<p>A number of the Government men were
assembled in a hut at a place known as the
"Stockyard," about a mile from the barracks,
one Saturday afternoon. It was their
intention to have a good feed, and they had
a big plum "duff" cooking; besides this,
by some means they got some wine. Three
of the number, thinking there was not enough
for everyone to have a decent allowance from,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
decided to make another pudding out of pipe-clay.
This was done, and, at a given signal,
two of them pretended to start fighting outside,
while the other was to remove the pudding
from the pot when nearly cooked, put
the pipe-clay padding in its place, and take
the wine also. All at once the cry was
raised, "A Fight! A Fight!" Everybody
rushed out to see it, and then the business
was done. The cook afterwards went to see
how the pudding was getting on, and saw
the water discoloured with pipeclay. "Dear
me," he said, "the sugar has all evaporated."
It was not the sugar that had evaporated,
though; it was the pudding. One old fellow
who was nearly three feet across the shoulders
was sitting by, and when he became
aware of what had taken place, he made his
usual remark, which was: "Well, well, well!
capitally done!" They did not try feasting
in a crowd again.</p>

<span class="subhead">Some Notable Constables.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Once a constable, no more a man."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Anon.</p>

<p>"Return good for evil" may be a very
good maxim to follow, but it was out of the
question when a man came into contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
some of the constables who were located in
the Settlement in olden days.</p>

<p>One of these, J&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, had been a
captain in the Native Cavalry in India, and
he was a fine horseman. But he was very
severe on the men, and if a man did the least
thing, swearing anything did not trouble
him. He occupied the position of barrack-master
till the men were robbed of their rations,
and then he got six months in irons. During
this six months the men had a chance of paying
back old debts, and they treated him
like a dog. This was only his deserts, however,
for he would lie in ambush with traps
set on purpose to catch a man, then get him
flogged. One of the men tried to cut his
nose off, but only got two years in irons for it,
besides 100 lashes, and all the time he was
being flogged he was singing out: "What do
I see but G&mdash; Almighty looking at me!"</p>

<p>This constable quarrelled with one of the
publicans, and brought a stool opposite the
hotel, where, on Sundays, he used to sit with
some other constables and watch that men
got no drink. I and some others arranged
to get into the hotel yard, and I came out
the front with a bottle of water under my
coat. Then, as soon as he saw me,
up he got off his stool and gave chase. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
went once round the block, and then, coming
to a crowd, let him catch up to me. He
grabbed the bottle, and found it was only
water; then he started to perform. "By
G&mdash;!" he said, "I'll bring you to court to-morrow,
I will, you d&mdash;&mdash;d scoundrel," gasping
for breath all the time, after the run I
had given him.</p>

<p>Another Sunday a man came out of an
hotel, and this constable went up to him and
said: "You've been drinking, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>"Let me smell your breath," he continued.</p>

<p>The constable went to smell his breath,
and the man spat in his face, exclaiming,
"There, you can smell that, and taste it too!"</p>

<p>He came on a group of cripples once, gambling
in the Old Stockade, and proceeded to
lock them up. This was a great sight. There
were wooden legs, crutches, sticks and fists
flying in all directions. At last, however, he
got help, and they were taken away and
locked up, brought to court the next day and
punished for their fun. Some got six months
in irons, others received fifty lashes; but
little did they care so long as he got knocked
about, for everybody disliked him.</p>

<p>As well as being constable, he was bailiff
in connection with the Small Debts Court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and if he got a chance, people were put to as
much trouble as possible. A woman whom
he had treated harshly in this way one day
went up and threw a dipper of hot water on
him, for which offence she was imprisoned a
week, but he did not have the satisfaction
of selling any of her furniture, as friends
came to the rescue and paid the debt.</p>

<p>At the first general election in 1843, a
large cask of ale was deposited on the main
street of the Settlement, and anyone who
wished could go and have a few drinks. The
pilot's crew got on the spree and attacked the
cripples, and it took this constable all his
time to look after them. Two boys also
started to fight, and he proceeded to lock
them up, but the crowd took their part and
prevented him. Some got fifty lashes, and
others twelve months in irons, while three
men were fined for not assisting the police.
As usual, the crutch and stick were freely
used. The pilot afterwards brought his men
to court, and some of them got a week in the
cells for abuse. Most of the men, however,
would rather have had "50" than go to the
cells, which were infested with vermin.</p>

<p>This constable once got information that
there was a private still some miles up the
river from the Settlement, and he lost no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
time in going to the Police Magistrate for a
search warrant. The granting of this warrant,
however, was delayed till a message
was sent to the owner of the still, who was a
great friend of the magistrate, to put him on
his guard. And when the constable arrived
on the scene, the still was removed, and he
could only find warm bricks. The manager
of the still met the constable with "Good
evening; it has been a warm day."</p>

<p>He said "Good evening," and proceeded
to read the warrant; then went and opened
the trap-door to look for the still.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" asked the
manager, "can I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; get me some tea, please!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the manager, "you had
better stop here to-night; you must be tired
after such a long ride in the heat. When
did you leave the Settlement?"</p>

<p>"Not soon enough to catch you," came
the reply.</p>

<p>"Catch me?" asked the manager. "Why,
you surprise me. What have I done?"</p>

<p>"You're very green," answered the constable;
"but I'll have you yet."</p>

<p>The constable searched all the next day,
but found no trace of the still, so the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
journey was for nothing. The fact was, this
still belonged to the aristocracy, who
could do almost as they pleased, but
it was nearly a case when the "broad arrow"
was put on a vessel in Sydney harbour on
her arrival from the Settlement with some
casks of grog aboard, and also the time that
a great quantity of grog was let loose in Port
Macquarie harbour one morning about breakfast-time.
This was hushed up somehow, for
there was not another word said about it.</p>

<p>After this useless search, the constable
offered a reward of &pound;20 to any man who
would go and stop for a while at the places
where this sly grog was sold, but he couldn't
get anybody to go, so he never caught them.</p>

<p>Many a wool-grower lost his sheep through
the sly grog-sellers. The liquor was made at
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, by &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, and publicly sold
on the New England road, without a license.
But as it came from &mdash;&mdash;, there was no notice
taken of it by those whose business it was to
remedy such evils.</p>

<p>On a Sunday, about this time, a ship arrived
at the Settlement with a number of
Government girls on board, who were all as
drunk as they could be, and this constable, as
usual, was down to see them land. The first
thing they did, when landed, was to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hold of him by the two shoulders and legs,
and throw him into the sea. They treated
Lankey, the flogger, in a similar manner, and
if it had not been for the interference of the
onlookers, they would probably have drowned
both of them, for they were looked upon as
the greatest ruffians of girls that had yet
landed in the Settlement. After considerable
trouble all were safely landed in the lock-up,
and if there was fun on Sunday, there was
still more on Monday, when they were
brought before the Bench. Here they swore
like troopers, and called the magistrates
everything they could think of; but this did
no good, for they got 12 months more added
to their sentence. One of them, when
leaving the court, hit a bystander across the
mouth with her shoe, and for this she
received still another 12 months. Imprisonment,
however, only made them worse and
shortly afterwards they were sent back to
Sydney. The captain of the ship which
brought these women was fined &pound;20 for
allowing them to have drink, and he also
lost his certificate.</p>

<p>This constable had one good point, and it
was that he would neither take tip nor
drink from anyone, and if he told a man he
would have him, that man had to look out or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
he was run in. Eventually his services as
constable were dispensed with, and he afterwards
opened an hotel. The case was altered
now, for the men on whom he had been so
severe used to go and 'stick up' drinks, and
never pay for them. Any of the men who
could get into his books only grinned at him,
and told him to go to a warmer climate when
asked for payment. "You cannot put us
in the lock-up as you could once, you old
brute; it is our turn now. Neither can you
stop us and smell our breath, for we have
smelt yours," they used to tell him. "Let
us have a couple more drinks, and then we
will pay you for the whole lot," and so on.</p>

<p>Tom &mdash;&mdash; got five gallons of beer out of
him, and tendered him a "joey" in payment
for it. He found out after Tom had gone,
and went after him. Tom only laughed and
told him to go up to Mr. So and So, and he
would get the cash, but he never got it.</p>

<p>Everybody took a delight in swindling
him; they did not forget the times when he
dragged them before the court and had them
flogged, just to show the P.M. what a strict
man he was.</p>

<p>One night he was having a snooze in his
easy chair on the verandah of the hotel, when
a man who knew him well, from a flogging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
point of view, got some pepper and put it
under his nose, and the noise he made sneezing
was nearly as good as a brass band.</p>

<p>At last he became insolvent, and everything
he had was sold under the hammer;
then he went to Sydney, much to the satisfaction
of all. There he would rent a house, and
in a short time make a "moonlight flit" and
let the landlord in for the rent. This game
did not last long, though, for he met one who
knew as much as he did, and he put the
bailiff in and sold him off.</p>

<p>Constable, No. 2, was a different man to
this, for he would take tips and drink with a
man, put him in the lock-up, let him out again,
and then tell another constable so that he
could arrest the same man and get a few
shillings. He was a flash, stuck-up fellow,
and thought more of himself than anyone
else did&mdash;but he would drink with all sorts
of men, no matter who they were. He was
plucky, though, for once when six men took
to the bush, he and some armed soldiers
went after them. These six men were
located in a house, and the constable ran up
to the window, pointed a pistol through, and
told them to surrender up their firearms and
come out one by one, which they did. A
soldier shot one of the runaways in the arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
which was a cowardly thing to do when the
men had given up their firearms, and had no
other means of defence. They were only
possessed of a few shillings, which they
scattered about the ground. These offenders
did little or no harm, and were only a set of
cowards after all to let one man take them.
This was all the better, however, as if they
had stuck out there must have been blood
spilt, for this constable declared that if there
had been any pluck in them, they could have
shot him and the soldiers into the bargain.
These men were sent to Sydney a few days
after being arrested, and finally to Norfolk
Island. One of them got hurt while at Norfolk
Island, returned to Port Macquarie, and
died.</p>

<p>This was not the only plucky capture
that the constable made, for he and
another took three armed bushrangers on the
road leading to the Manning River. One of
these men was from Lake Innes, and was
doing a term of 12 months for knocking a
man down in company with three others.
After getting out of the iron gang he was
sent to a road party, from which he took to
the bush, and when arrested was sent to Norfolk
Island for life.</p>

<p>When this constable went to Sydney with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a few prisoners on one occasion, he got into
the company of some soldiers and officers,
and to them he passed as a captain. They
invited him to dine with them in his uniform,
but he had no other uniform than the convict
dress, and this invitation took the "wind
out of his sails." When the officers found
out how nicely they had trapped him, they
tried to ascertain his whereabouts, but he
had returned to Port Macquarie where he
posed as what he really was. The officers
afterwards found out where he was, and
wrote to the Police Magistrate regarding the
incident. The P.M. then accosted him, and
he said: "I made as much of myself in
Sydney as I could, and no one could blame
me for it."</p>

<p>Some time afterwards this constable
became sick and died, and thus ended his
career.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">At Rollands Plains.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Life as tedious as a twice-told tale."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Rollands Plains is situated some twenty
miles from Port Macquarie in a westerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
direction, and derived its name from Surveyor
Rollands, who laid it out. This place was
made a farming centre some time after a
settlement was formed at Port Macquarie, as
it was considered good country both for
agricultural and pastoral pursuits.</p>

<p>Early in the forties a road party was
picked out of the men who were in the main
Settlement, and they were despatched to
Rollands Plains for road-making purposes&mdash;many
of the thoroughfares which remain
there at the present time being the outcome
of the labour of these men.</p>

<p>About this time there was a doctor residing
at the Plains, and as an experiment to make
some kind of ointment, he had several large
cedar boxes constructed, each one being of
sufficient size to hold the carcases of four
bullocks. In due course the cases were filled
with the dead oxen, and the four boxes
lowered into the bed of the creek&mdash;the
supposition being that in a certain length of
time all the flesh and fat would become
separate substances. The boxes had not
been under water long, however, before
heavy weather came on, which caused the
creek to become flooded, and the encased
oxen were swept down stream. When the
flood waters subsided search was made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
these cases, but only one was found, and it
was filled with sand, mud, etc. So the
doctor's loss was considerable, as the cedar
boxes alone were worth some money.</p>

<p>During this flood most of the farms around
the place were in a state of inundation, and
all kinds of farm produce was strewn about
in all directions; cedar logs, which had been
washed down, were plentiful, too. The men
in the road party went about gathering these
products, for it was seldom that they got
anything of the kind. They proceeded to
cook some potatoes which had been collected,
when the supposed owner of the "spuds"
came up and wanted to take a number of
sweet potatoes out of the pot whilst they
were boiling, claiming them as his property.
The men could not see losing the potatoes,
and blankly refused to give them up. He
then laid a complaint to the boss of the
party, who said: "Well, if you can swear
that nobody else about here has sweet
potatoes but yourself, you can take them."
But the hungry individual failed to do this,
and so had to go without his "murphys."</p>

<p>The weather cleared up, and the men in
the party were sent to assist the residents
near at hand to pull what remained of their
maize crops, and when the first day's labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was over, they asked the farmer whom they
had been helping for some tea and sugar.
He looked at them for a moment, and then
answered: "I will not give you a d&mdash;&mdash; bit;
you have stolen plenty of potatoes and
pumpkins, and if you don't help me finish
the corn-pulling, I'll get your rumps tanned.
Since the road party came here, I can't keep
fowls, turnips, cabbage, or anything else."
This was his thanks, and also his usual way
of doing business.</p>

<p>One young fellow tried to do the men in
the road party a good turn, by killing one of
his master's calves for them. But while he
was in the act of killing it, the calf bellowed
out and drew the master's attention, when
he ran up and caught the culprit, and got
him six months in irons for trying to do
others a good turn.</p>

<p>It was not an unusual thing in the old
days to see one or more of the female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
convicts sitting in stocks about the streets of
the Settlement, suffering a recovery from
drink. Most of these women were quite
equal to their liquor, like the men, when
they could get it. The principal drink was
rum, and nice stuff it was, too; there was
plenty of tobacco juice in it, so that when
anyone got two or three drinks aboard, they
were in a fairly muddled state. When a
man went into an hotel, the cry was generally:
"Shout, now, or out you go!" and
some of the publicans kept a plate of salt
herring on the counter, and it goes without
saying that they soon got paid for the fish.</p>

<p>Two servants, Polly &mdash;&mdash; and Sarah &mdash;&mdash;,
used to be employed at one of the
hotels, and the fact that they each had a
sweetheart was well known to almost everybody.
These two servants were working
away in the hotel as usual one day, and there
was a good gathering of men discussing
different matters not far away. While thus
assembled they noticed these two girls at the
hotel, and the conversation immediately
drifted on to them. This wound up in
betting me a bottle of rum that I could not
start the two fighting. I at once undertook
the contract, proceeded up to Polly, and,
pointing to Sarah, said: "She pretends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
be a great friend of yours, doesn't she?"
"Yes," was the reply. "Well," I said,
"you should hear the way that she runs you
and your sweetheart down." I got her sufficiently
excited in this way, and then went to
Sarah and told her the same things about
Polly. They flew at each other in a terrible
rage, and fought like two cats, then I commenced
to laugh and to think how nice the
rum would be. But they found out the joke
also, when the crowd began to laugh, and it
was a good job for me that I could run well,
as they each picked up a clothes prop and
chased me for my life. I then went and got
my rum.</p>

<p>Polly was sent to this country for trying
to poison her uncle and aunt to get their
money. She had not been long in the
Settlement before she became intimate with
a man who was sent from Sydney for having
sore legs. One day she quarrelled with
this fellow, and, when night came on, she
attempted to commit suicide by taking a
dose of oxalic acid. The poison was taken
shortly before retiring to bed, when she laid
out a number of clean underclothes on a
table in the servants' room, and said to her
mate: "Sarah, to-night when I'm dead, I
want you to put these clothes on me; I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a row with Jack to-day, and I've taken some
oxalic acid, as I don't wish to live any
longer."</p>

<p>Sarah was thunder-stricken at this state of
affairs, and when she recovered herself, said:
"You big fool; I would not poison myself
for all the sore-legged brutes in the world."
She then went and told the boss of the hotel
all the circumstances, and in a few minutes
the whole house was in a state of confusion.
The doctor arrived, and the police also came
on the scene. The former took the necessary
steps to extract the poison from her, while
the latter inquired into the circumstances
and "wet their whistle." After a few days
Polly got better, and was then sent to the
lock-up for a week for being silly.</p>

<p>Afterwards she returned to the hotel, and
made it up with the rotten-legged man&mdash;both
the servants then getting into their usual
habit of going out at night to meet their
sweethearts. One night the boss forbade
them to go out, as his wife was ill with an
abscess on her arm. They, however, would
not be baffled after making an appointment,
so they dressed up two "dummies," and
affixed a melon with a night-cap on as a
head-piece for each, giving anyone the
impression at first sight that they were both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in bed and asleep. Towards the middle of
the night the boss went to their door and
called them, as his wife's arm was very
painful, and she wanted another poultice
made for it. He got no answer, so opened
the door, looked in, and believed both of
them to be asleep. Finally, he walked over
and shook one of them, but when one of
the night caps rolled off, and the melon
became exposed to view, his language of
flowers was not choice.</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Anon.</p>

<p>A crowd of men were assembled in the
main street of the Settlement one night, and
as everything was very quiet, and the place
seemed to be practically dead, they decided
to try and make some fun. A crotchety old
couple lived in a house not far away, so it
was suggested and agreed that a commencement
be made on them. Two tom-cats were
caught and knotted together with wire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
swung across the knob of the front door.
There was a continuous strain of cats' music
for a few seconds, and then Old &mdash;&mdash;
opened the door, only to receive a nasty
scratch from one of the cats as he did it.
The crowd lay in ambush watching the proceedings,
and enjoying the fun immensely,
and the next thing they saw was a knife on
the end of a stick being used to cut the cats
asunder; but wire was not so easily cut, and
this only tended to increase the music, as one
of the "toms" received a gash occasionally.
Finally, when everything failed, he got a
clothes-prop and lifted them off the door-knob,
carried them down to the wharf, and
hurled them into the river. So the play
ended.</p>

<p>Two conspicuous individuals in the Settlement
were always quarrelling over a girl, so
it was decided to persuade them to fight a
duel, and this was arranged after a little
difficulty. An hour was then appointed on
a certain day, when they should both put in
an appearance on the beach, there to settle
all disputes. The day came, and the men
turned up. Two pistols were handed to
them, each one being loaded with thick
bullock's blood, and a substantial wad
separating it from the powder. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
stood up, shook hands, then walked a few
paces, and, turning round, fired at each other.
Both were now besmattered with blood,
and thought that they were really wounded.
I thought the spectators would never stop
laughing, but at last the duellers saw through
the joke, and after this similar events were
at a standstill.</p>

<p>"Flash &mdash;&mdash;" was a well-known
character in the Settlement in former days,
and was a carpenter by trade. He built a
house for a colonel's wife once, and when it
was finished she would not pay him. But
he had bought liquor from her on several
occasions, and when she refused to pay him
he informed on her, and she was fined &pound;30
for sly-grog selling.</p>

<p>A tall old fellow, named S&mdash;&mdash;, used to
be a kind of "flunky" in Port Macquarie,
and he was a great rum-drinker. His bed
was near the window in a house facing the
main street. Fish were biting well, and one
night a shovel-nosed shark was landed. This
old fellow was lying in his bed drunk, so it
was arranged to have some fun with him.
The shark was carried up; one of the crowd
raised the window gently and pulled the
blankets off him, while another lowered the
shark in on top of him. The fish naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
began to wriggle, and all that the crowd
heard as they made a hurried exit, was
"Murder!" "murder!!" The next morning
a lifeless shark lay scenting the street
gutter.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Aborigines.</span></h2>

<p class="blkquot">"Gimme 'bacca, you pleas, massa."</p>

<p class="citation">&mdash;Australian Aboriginal.</p>

<p>Aboriginals were plentiful in the forties,
and they had the "run of their knife" then
a little more than they do now. A murder
amongst them was a common occurrence,
and not infrequently was a head severed
from a body in a quarrel over a bottle of
rum. Occasionally they went further than
this, for several members of a white family
were murdered by blacks at Rollands Plains.
The father of this family was a sawyer, and
they killed him first while working at a cedar
tree in the bush. The house containing the
mother and children was then attacked, but
the mother, it is supposed, on hearing the
blacks trying to enter the house, threw her
infant, only a few months old, out of the
back window, and this child was the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
member of the family that escaped, it
being found the day afterwards. The chief
perpetrator of this deed was a blackfellow
named "Terramidgee," who paid the penalty
by being hanged in front of the Port
Macquarie Gaol. To act as a warning, all
the aborigines around the Settlement were
collected together to witness the punishment.</p>

<p>It did not appear to be much of a warning,
however, as about the year 1849 another
cedar-cutter was murdered on the upper
portion of Rollands Plains. This sawyer
had adopted a young aboriginal, and when
considered old enough to learn, he was sent
to school in Sydney. After being away for
some years he grew into a fine youth, and
on returning, used to assist his master with
the cedar. Two or three years elapsed in
this way, until one day a tribe of blacks
came to the old sawyer and demanded tobacco
and rations, which he refused to give them.
This colored youth, however, whose name
was "Mogo Gard," made the necessary
arrangements with the other aboriginals to
murder the master that night, which was
accordingly done, and they cleared the hut of
everything and took to the bush. When the
murder became known, the police were
communicated with, and, on arrival, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
suspected "Mogo," and shortly afterwards
he was arrested and conveyed to Port
Macquarie. He was placed in heavy irons,
tried, and afterwards transferred to Sydney,
where a sentence of death was passed on him.
When the vessel which conveyed this murderer
to Sydney entered the Heads, he
attempted to jump overboard, but was
noticed in time to be prevented from doing
so. At the gallows, when the rope was
being put around his neck, he looked at the
hangman, and said; "No, bale you put 'im
that place, you put 'im here," pointing to his
waist. But he had to pay the last penalty
of the law. He was a tremendous man,
standing six feet seven inches in height,
besides being broad in proportion; and was
a splendid specimen of the Australian
aboriginal.</p>

<p>Amongst the other aboriginals who were
in the main Settlement was a notorious thief,
named "Micky," who was also a splendidly-built
blackfellow. I caught him one day
stealing money from a man who was stopping
at Colley's hotel. I informed on him, and
the magistrate ordered him to be given 50
lashes. In due course he received the
flogging, and at every smack, he said, "By
G&mdash;, G&mdash;&mdash;, I not Guv'ment man!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Once I had a keg of rum, and when I was
away from home "Micky" used to break in
and steal it; so I vowed at last that I'd get
even with him. I had some laudanum on
hand, which I used for my eyes, so I got a
bottle, put some rum in it, and then added
some of the laudanum. This I left in a convenient
place for him, and went away as
usual to my work. Sure enough the bait
was taken, and then he lay asleep on the
road for a day and a-half. I was driving a
cart at the time, and would have driven over
him (for he was a terrible thief) only I was
afraid the cart would be tracked, and I'd get
into trouble. "Micky" did not come back
for any more rum.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cleverest piece of work ever
done by an aboriginal in the Settlement, was
carried out by "Charles Merriman," a well-known
blackfellow. On one occasion some
prisoners bolted from the gaol, and a black-tracker
was wanted. "Merriman" was the
chosen tracker, but did not seem to care
about the billet. He, however, was forced
to accompany two policemen in search of the
runaways, and was attired in the usual
uniform of a policeman. As they travelled
away from the town on horseback, the police
noticed that the tracker was going very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
against his will. At last when they had gone
six or seven miles out, he asked one of the
police to hold his horse saying: "I been see
it something up in the ferns, there." He ran
up into the tall ferns, picked up a stick, took
the cap off and placed it on top of the stick,
which he stuck in the ground, so that only
the cap could be seen above the ferns. He
then made a bee-line for the Settlement.
Some time elapsed, and the constable rode up
to see what he was doing, only to find,
much to his disgust, that, snake-like, "Merriman"
had shed his coat.</p>

<p>In 1843 I became a free man, and, after
the knocking about I had had for some years,
sought the most comfortable quarters I could.
I went to the "Speed the Plough" hotel,
which was kept by Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and there I
found a good home, besides plenty to eat and
drink, and a good bed to sleep on. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
few months, however, I decided to leave
Port Macquarie and go to Sydney, from
whence I walked to Windsor, Parramatta,
and other places in search of work. Not
being successful in this direction, however, I
decided to wend my way back to Port, and
eventually arrived overland at Maitland.
Here a constable came up to me and inquired
where I had come from, and "Was I free?"
I told him where I had been, and also that I
was a free man. He then asked me what
proof I had to show that I was free, and I
presented to him the pass that I had
received from the Police Office in Port Macquarie.
He looked at this for a little while,
and then informed me that it was no good,
and that I would have to go with him to the
lock-up. I told him that it was a hard case
after serving my term to be shut up in the
lock-up again; but he said that the pass was
no good, and he could not help it&mdash;so off I
went.</p>

<p>The next day I was brought before the
Police Magistrate, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, as a bolter;
he asked me where I got the pass, and I told
him. He then asked me how long I had
been at Port Macquarie, adding that anyone
could buy a pass like the one I had for half-a-crown.
I told him I wished I had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that, and I would have got one years ago.
On hearing this, he ordered the constable to
take me away, and bring me up again next
morning, when he would sentence me to 100
lashes. "That," I said, "is more than you
dare do!" and I was marched away.</p>

<p>Instead of being brought up again the
next morning, I was sent away to Newcastle
Gaol for identification. There I was kept
three weeks, until one afternoon Major C&mdash;&mdash;
walked in, and I spoke to him, with the
result was that I was sent to Sydney the same
night.</p>

<p>The next day Old Tim came into the lock-up,
where I and some others were. He gave
them orders to do something but I
was not on a par with other prisoners, and so
did not comply with it. He sang out to me,
"Here, you with the whiskers, stand up and
let me see you!" I stood up, and as soon as
he saw me he said, "Your face is quite
familiar to me; you've been here often, and
it's not the first time you've tried the same
dodge, you scoundrel!" I said, "You've
never seen me before, Tim," and at being
called Tim he got into a terrible rage, while
I stood grinning at him. Then he said, "By
G&mdash;, you're not free, I'll get it sent home
to you, you saucy b&mdash;&mdash;!" Then he left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and one of his flash subordinates came into
the lock-up with the "hominy," and he told
me that if I were not a free man I would
catch it, as the super was in a great rage at
being called "Tim."</p>

<p>At 10 o'clock the same day I was sent
into the office before Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, and "Tim"
was there to see how things went. I was
put under the stand to have my height
tested, and my marks were taken, the result
of the examination being that my freedom
was proved. A paper to this effect was
handed to me before leaving the office, and I
shook it at "Tim" as I left.</p>

<p>When I was put into the lock-up, I was
possessed of three shirts, a razor, a new silk
handkerchief, and a new pair of trousers. I
asked the lock-up-keeper for them, but was
only pushed out and told to go to &mdash;&mdash;. So
I went back to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; and complained,
and he soon ordered my things to be handed
over to me.</p>

<p>I now started a second time to walk from
Sydney to Port Macquarie&mdash;a distance of
over 200 miles&mdash;with ninepence in my pocket
with which to buy food on the journey. I
got along all right until I reached the A. A.
Company's land near Stroud, where I was
almost starving. Coming through this land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
however, I came by good fortune on a camp
in which there was a piece of damper about
a week old, which I gladly ate, and I would
have eaten it had it been a year old, for it
was a matter of eat what you could get.</p>

<p>I could not swim then, nor have I learned
since, consequently, when I came to a river,
I either had to cross it at the head, or else
lash some dead timber together, make a raft,
and get across the rivers in that manner.</p>

<p>Finally I arrived at the Manning river,
and at this place had a peculiar experience
with a woman named Miss &mdash;&mdash;. She stuck
me up with a pistol, asked me my name and
also where I had come from. I gave her
these particulars satisfactorily, and she then
asked me if I were free, and to show her my
freedom. I told her that I had travelled all
the way from Sydney, and she was the first
woman policeman I had met. After this she
wanted me to take a letter to Port Macquarie
for her, but I declined, and notwithstanding
that she assured me it was not
heavy, I told her to take it herself, as it was
only fifty miles. So I proceeded to Port
Macquarie without the letter after her
impudence to me, and arrived there two
days later. It was not long after this before
I got constant work.</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 15, 1851, there
was great excitement in Port Macquarie, for
this was the day on which, in attempting to
cross the bar at the entrance to the harbor,
the yacht "Wanderer" had become a total
wreck. This yacht had sailed nearly all
round the world, besides to a good many
islands in the Pacific. She was owned by a
man named Boyd, and was a picture as she
appeared on the ocean in full sail. This unfortunate
man, however, went ashore at the
Island of Guadalcama, where the ship had
been prior to coming to Port Macquarie, and
never returned to the yacht again, the supposition
being that he was murdered by the
natives. There were four white men on board
the "Wanderer" when she arrived at Port
Macquarie, who were:&mdash;Captain Ottowell,
master; Mr. Webster, artist; Mr. Barnes,
botanist; and Mr. Crawford (Boyd's nephew),
mate. Besides these there were a number of
natives from different islands, and one of the
publicans in Port Macquarie got the "niggers"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
dancing in his hotel to draw custom.</p>

<p>All the men came ashore from the wreck
on rope, and, save a little wetting, were none
the worse for their experience. The wreck
was sold to a local man. On board the ship
were some beautiful paintings and views of
the different places that the yacht had visited,
besides many skulls, native implements of
war, shells, and many other things. Amongst
the articles were suits of both the Emperor
of China and the Shah of Persia, and for a
wager two gentlemen of the town donned
these costumes and walked the streets. All
the goods out of the vessel were afterwards
open to public view in a large store, and
some of the cannon balls and other material
which belonged to the yacht yet remain in
Port Macquarie. The white men from the
yacht afterwards spent a good deal of their
time at Lake Innes, where they engaged in
sporting and other pursuits.</p>

<p>On a sunny summer's day, in the year
1850, three little girls were playing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
green slopes overlooking the sea at Port
Macquarie. "Look!" said one of them to
her playmates, "what are those little dots
out on the sea?" All three now stood in
amazement, watching the little specs which
were being wafted nearer and nearer as each
emerald wave of the ocean hurried onward to
its destination&mdash;the shore. They were not
specs very long; it was soon discernible that
they were boats, but who were the occupants?
This was a question yet to be solved. The
pilot boat went off, but the people in the
other boats bore such a rough appearance
that the pilot was almost afraid to go
near them. At last a member of the pilot's
crew recognised one of the men in the strange
boats, and they then proceeded to go alongside.
A tale of shipwreck was now related.
It transpired that some time previously one
of the shipwrecked crew had left Port
Macquarie for the Californian goldfields,
whither there was a general rush from most
parts of the world. Now he was returning,
but not under very auspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>The fact was that the barque "Rosetta
Joseph" had left San Francisco about the
15th October, 1850, bound for Sydney. All
went well with her until the 2nd day of
December following, when to the dismay of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
all on board, the ill-fated vessel struck upon
a reef, known as the "Elizabeth Reef," at
11 o'clock on a Sunday night. There was
no hope of saving the ship. The passengers,
captain, and crew managed to leave the
wreck by means of the boats, and 48 souls in
all left the vessel, 32 being in the largest
boat, and 16 in a smaller one&mdash;the third and
smallest boat being used as a sea-anchor.
A course was then steered for Port
Macquarie, and after eight days and nine
nights their destination was safely reached
on the 11th December, when they landed at
a spot known as Boat Harbour. This object
was not accomplished, however, without the
usual adventures of the sea. Two gales were
encountered while in the boats, and it was
during the first of these gales, in the open
sea, that the third boat was made into a sea-anchor,
and they then lay-to till the weather
abated. The second gale arose when the
boats had made the coast, and were off a spot
known as Point Plomer, near Port Macquarie.
Here they again lay-to, but were driven to
the south, the next place that land was
sighted being off the Camden Haven river.
From this place they steered north towards
Tacking Point, as some of those on board,
from previous experience of the coast, knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
where they were. On arrival at the Boat
Harbour, the boats being too large to enter,
the pilot boat brought a few of the shipwrecked
persons in at a time till they were
all safely landed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The experience at sea was a perilous one,
and those in the boats suffered terribly from
exposure. At one time it was thought that
the second largest boat and its occupants
were lost. A huge wave swept over her, and
for a short time she seemed swallowed up,
but a few seconds later she reappeared on
the crest of another wave, the occupants being
engaged in bailing water for their lives. A
box of gold valued at &pound;30,000 was put into
the largest boat on leaving the ship, but
when the first gale was encountered it had
to be jettisoned, as well as all the passengers'
clothes, with the exception of what they
wore, in order to lighten the boat. There
was only a limited supply of food in the
boats, too, and a small quantity of this,
together with a cup of water, was served out
to each person every day, because they did
not know how long it would be before land
was sighted. So that besides losing the
gold, the food supply in the boats was none
too large.</p>

<p>After the convicts left Port Macquarie,
the gaol was made a kind of relieving place
for other gaols in the colony which became
overcrowded, and at times there were a good
many prisoners within its walls. About the
year 1866, six prisoners who were evidently
full of being shut up in the large brick
structure overlooking the Pacific ocean, were
successful in making their escape. This they
accomplished by digging a hole in the wall
with a piece of an old knife, the work
extending over a period of several weeks.
The floor of the gaol was not right on the
ground, but built up somewhat, and therefore
an aperture existed between it and the
ground. A flooring board used to be removed
underneath one of the beds, and only one
man worked at a time, being relieved by
another when he had done his quota. It
was one morning about daylight that these
six men made their escape, and proceeded
along the Old Lake road (which leads from
Port Macquarie to Lake Innes), removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the leg irons which they wore as soon as the
bush was reached. They walked along the
road one behind the other, leaving a track
which appeared as though only one man had
traversed the road. Arriving at Lake Innes
they secured breakfast, and sought firearms,
but the residents at the Lake at that time
(not Major Innes) told the prisoners that
they possessed no guns. The six men were
afterwards seated on a log eating their
breakfast when a Port Macquarie citizen,
who had heard of their escape, galloped to
Lake Innes and fired a gun over the
runaways' heads. This naturally had the
effect of scattering them, and they proceeded
further south to the Green Hills, near the
Camden Haven river, and hid in ambush.</p>

<p>Whilst all this had been going on, the
police were informed of their escape, and
went in search of the men. They, however,
did not effect a capture, although the
prisoners saw them go past while they lay
hidden in the bush, and they returned
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In crossing Kathie Creek, which lies
to the south between Port Macquarie and
the Green Hills, one of the escapees was
stung by a stingray, and he in company with
another afterwards gave themselves up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the authorities. The other men were
captured by the police on the New England
road, about 20 miles from Port Macquarie.</p>

<p>Such was the life in Old Port Macquarie.
But what does it all matter now? Did any
of the tyrants ever derive any benefit by
hounding down and torturing their fellow
men? Nay! most of those whose career I
have followed did no good, while some died
like dogs. They say that there is punishment
for doers of harsh deeds this side of the
grave, and if ever this fact were realised, it
was by many of those heartless wretches who
gloried in driving their subordinates to
desperation day by day. Thank Heaven I
have lived all this down, and although
"declined into the vale of years," still I am
glad to know and say that there yet remains
a gleam of sunshine, as there is a silver lining
to every cloud, for me to enjoy in my
latter days.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
